        data on BODS: timetables and fares data.
-   Timetables data catalogue: this contains a detailed granular view of the
        timetables data within BODS. It also contains a detailed mapping of the BODS
        timetables data with the data from the Office of the Traffic Commissioner (OTC).
-   Organisations data catalogue: this contains helpful counts of data at an
        organisation level: which is at the level of the publishing operators (e.g
        overall service data)
