Data Catalogue
The data catalogue zip contains a series of CSVs which gives a machine-readable overview of all the data that resides in BODS currently.

Note that the data catalogue only covers the data from primary data sources on BODS which is timetables data in TransxChange format, bus location data in SIRI-VM format and fares data in NeTEx format. Other non-primary data on BODS (e.g disruptions data or GTFS converted forms) are not represented on the data catalogue.

The data catalogue zip contains 6 distinct CSVs:
-   Overall data catalogue: this contains a high-level overview of all the static data on BODS: timetables and fares data.
-   Timetables data catalogue: this contains a detailed granular view of the timetables data within BODS. It also contains a detailed mapping of the BODS timetables data with the data from the Office of the Traffic Commissioner (OTC).
-   Fares data catalogue: this contains a detailed granular view of the fares data within BODS.
-   Organisations data catalogue: this contains helpful counts of data at an organisation level: which is at the level of the publishing operators (e.g overall service data)
-   Location data catalogue: this contains a detailed granular view of the automatic vehicle location data within BODS.
-   Operator NOC data catalogue: this describes all organisations on BODS and the National Operator Codes (NOCs) that are associated with them.

Field definitions:
The data catalogue contains certain fields the definitions and explanations of which
