Data Catalogue
The data catalogue zip contains a series of CSVs which gives a machine-readable
overview of all the data that resides in BODS currently.

Note that the data catalogue only covers the data from primary data sources on BODS
which is timetables data in TransxChange format, bus location data in SIRI-VM format
and fares data in NeTEx format. Other non-primary data on BODS (e.g GTFS converted forms)
are not represented on the data catalogue.

The data catalogue zip contains 7 distinct CSVs:
-   Overall data catalogue: this contains a high-level overview of all the static data on BODS: timetables and fares data.
-   Timetables data catalogue: this contains a detailed granular view of the timetables data within BODS. It also contains a detailed mapping of the BODS timetables data with the data from the Office of the Traffic Commissioner (OTC).
-   Fares data catalogue: this contains a detailed granular view of the fares data within BODS.
-   Disruptions data catalogue: this contains a detailed view of all of the disruptions active and pending within BODS
-   Organisations data catalogue: this contains helpful counts of data at an organisation level.
-   Location data catalogue: this contains an overview of the location data within BODS.
-   Operator NOC data catalogue: this describes all organisations on BODS and the National Operator Codes (NOCs) that are associated with them.

Field definitions:
The data catalogue contains certain fields the definitions and explanations of which can be found below.

                                                    Default state for correctly published services, will be “No” unless any of the logic below is met.
                                                    Yes:
                                                    Yes if OTC status = Registered and Scope Status = In scope and Seasonal Status ≠ Out of season and Published Status = Unpublished.
                                                    Yes if OTC status = Registered and Scope Status = In scope and Seasonal Status ≠ Out of season and Published Status = Published and Timeliness Status ≠ Up to date.
Published Status                             		Published: Published to BODS by an Operator/Agent.
							                        Unpublished: Not published to BODS by an Operator/Agent.

                                                    Method 2:
                                                    Data for that service code has been updated with a 'XML:Operating Period Start Date' which equals OTC variation effective date.
