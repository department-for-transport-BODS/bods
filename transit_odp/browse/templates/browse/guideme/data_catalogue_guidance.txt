Data Catalogue
The data catalogue zip contains a series of CSVs which gives a machine-readable
overview of all the data that resides in BODS currently.

Note that the data catalogue only covers the data from primary data sources on BODS
which is timetables data in TransxChange format, bus location data in SIRI-VM format
and fares data in NeTEx format. Other non-primary data on BODS (e.g disruptions data
or GTFS converted forms) are not represented on the data catalogue.

The data catalogue zip contains 4 distinct CSVs:
-   Overall data catalogue: this contains a high-level overview of all the static
       data on BODS: timetables and fares data.
-   Timetables data catalogue: this contains a detailed granular view of the
       timetables data within BODS. It also contains a detailed mapping of the BODS
       timetables data with the data from the Office of the Traffic Commissioner (OTC).
-   Organisations data catalogue: this contains helpful counts of data at an
       organisation level: which is at the level of the publishing operators (e.g
       overall service data)
-   Location data catalogue: this contains a detailed granular view of the automatic
       vehicle location data within BODS.
