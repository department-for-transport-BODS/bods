            An addition of a feedback page wherein any user can give
            a rating and a feedback on the user experience of the web
            pages on BODS. The feedback in turn can be accessed readily
            by DfT admin users. This will enable our team to
            continuously improve the BODS website experience. (Note
            that this is different from the feedback function on
            specific data sets/feeds on BODS).

    <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
            A small update to the PTI logic of BODS where the as is
            functionality is: Review all files in new zip with same
            service code that have changed (hash
            of file changes) &rarr; Identify highest revision number from
            previous zip for that service code &rarr; Fail any amended
            files in new zip that do not have a higher revision number
            than highest from previous zip. This will be changed to
            the new updated PTI logic which will be: Review all files
            in new zip with same service code/line combination that
            have changed (hash of file changes) &rarr;
            Identify highest revision number from previous zip for
            that service code/line combination &rarr; Fail all new or
            amended files in new zip (with that service code/line
            combination) that
            do not have a higher revision number than highest from
            previous zip.
        {% endblocktrans %}

            Some generic content updates to the entire website (in
            particular the guidance section) along with a few other
            high priority bugs (and some back-end updates) to
            improve the overall performance of the service.

        The team has worked on a number of high-value feature updates
        that will be available to all publishers including:
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
            A new 'Guide Me' section for all publishers which simplifies and puts a step
            by step guide to how to go about publishing and maintaining data on BODS.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
            A new Publisher dashboard. All publishers once logged-in will now be able to
            view all the different feature options they have on BODS and select their
            relevant flow. A simplified ‘Review my published data’ dashboard is also now
            available for Publisher and Agent users, where they can review the status of
            the different operators that they are agents for.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
            A new ‘Data requiring attention’ section for all publishers and agents which
            highlights to all operators the service codes which are available on the OTC
            (Office of the Traffic Commissioner) database but have not been found in the
            BODS data that has been uploaded by publishers. This includes a downloadable
            CSV.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
            A new ‘Data consumer activity’ section showcasing the total consumer
            interactions with the data for a given operator’s data. This is intended to
            give the publishers a more granular idea about how their data is being
            utilized by consumers (e.g. passenger app developers, researchers) on BODS.
            This section includes two downloadable CSVs: one related to granular data
            interactions with the operator’s data, and the other relates to the direct
            feedback that has been received by operators on their published data.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
            An additional summarised version of the PTI validation report. This
            simplifies and gives an overview of the major errors in the data as it
            passes through our PTI TransXChange validator.

            Admin portal pages for DfT have been updated on BODS with functionality
            including searchable text boxes and sorting functions across organisation
            management, agent management and consumer management. This will enable
            easier and more convenient navigation on the admin portal for DfT.

            The team has also worked on updating the download metrics on the platform.
            This will enable the DfT to truly track the utilisation of BODS and work
            with consumers to ensure higher adoption/usage of the platform.

            A bulk of technical debts accrued over the past year have now been improved.
            This means the code base on BODS is cleaned up which will enable a better
            functioning overall platform.
        {% endblocktrans %}

    <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
            Updates have been made to the developer documentation on Find BODS pages which
            adds more details on GTFS formats available on the platform. The documentation
            for data quality is now also updated to reflect the accurate description of
            how data quality is measured on BODS. Both these changes will enable more
            guidance and transparency on the features available on the platform.
