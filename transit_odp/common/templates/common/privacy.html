                        The Bus Open Data Service (BODS) is a service for bus operators across England,
                        and local transport authorities or agents working with operators, to publish
                        data about local bus services. It is a legal requirement for bus operators
                        across England to publish this data, so that application developers and other
                        data consumers can use this data without restrictions in their applications,
                        products and research. The service is provided by the Department for Transport.
