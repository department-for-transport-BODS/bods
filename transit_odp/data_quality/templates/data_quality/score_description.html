              Passengers rely on high-quality information being provided to the Bus
              Open Data Service. The data quality score have been defined by the Department

                Data quality observations are divided into critical and advisory
                observations.
                Operators should aim to have zero critical observations in their data.
                Advisory observations should be investigated and addressed.
                Alternatively, if the observation is a result of intended behaviour an
                operator can suppress the observation.

                Only critical observations are included in the data quality measurement.
                For each type of critical observation, the percentage of tests passed is calculated.
                These are then used to find the weighted average percentage, using the
                following weightings:

                If you have two services in a data set, and one of them has a
                backward date range, then only 50% of the backward date range tests
                have been passed. As backward date range can contribute a maximum
                of 12% of the score, in this case you would only get 50% of that
                12%, which is a 6% contribution in this case.
                These contribution are summed to give the final data quality score.

                The service expects operators to be meeting the Green data quality standard for all

                operators to identify issues in their data. Operators should aim to have zero critical
