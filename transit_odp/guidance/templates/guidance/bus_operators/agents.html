  Agents are defined as people outside the operator’s organisation that can publish
  data on behalf of an operator. Mostly commonly, these will be local transport
  authorities. It is expected that operators will have contracts establishing the
  services and expectations with agents, prior to allocating them as an agent on
  this service.

  Please ensure the operator invites all the agent users to be agents for their
  organisation, this may be multiple emails for local authority. Alternatively,
  agents may wish to use a functional mailbox for the agent user account. However,
  this will limit people that can log in at once to those with the same external
  IP address.
