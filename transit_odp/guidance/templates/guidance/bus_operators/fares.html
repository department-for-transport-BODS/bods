            During 2019 industry standard leads developed the UK NeTEx profile, to standardise the publication of fares data within the UK bus industry. NeTEx is a highly interoperable CEN standard that can be used to represent various aspects of multi-modal transport networks, including both timetables and fares. For this reason, NeTEx may be considered for expanded used by DfT in the future.

            Operators will be able to use the free Fare Data Build Tool to produce their own NeTEx.
            The tool can be found here:

            Operators who have ETM suppliers can talk with them about hosted NeTEx solutions.
            A large proportion of fares data already resides within ETM systems.
            This can be leveraged to provide NeTEx to BODS. There may be a need for additional
            product development, so ensure your needs are understood by your supplier.

            For the creation of NeTEx files using bespoke NeTEx tools, operators can input a
            start date in the future to make sure that the relevant tickets are applicable for
            the relevant amount of time.

            Operators that maintain easy to understand fare structure will see many benefits moving forward. These include but are not limited to the following; increased usage of their data by data consumers, increased exposure of fares information to passengers, improved representation of offerings by third parties, increased public trust, increased patronage, and easier revenue apportionment. Easier fares are endorsed by the DfT, passengers and local transport authorities.
