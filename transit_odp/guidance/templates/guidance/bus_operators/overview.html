            The Bus Open Data Service (BODS) is the central service for publishing high
            quality information for all local bus services in England. The Bus Services Act
            2017 requires operators of local bus services in England to publish data to the
            Bus Open Data Service. There are three types of data that operators must publish
            in certain data formats: timetables, bus location and fares. Local transport
            authorities are required to maintain NaPTAN stop data.
