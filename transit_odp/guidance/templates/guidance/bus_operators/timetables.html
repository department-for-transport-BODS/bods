            Operators will be expected to upgrade their systems/processes and upskill their staff to provide timetables data to the
            service in the TransXChange Version 2.4 from 31st December 2020. The Bus Open Data Service is now ready for operators to
            start publishing their data.

            Timetables data must be published using TransXChange (TxC); the agreed industry
            standard for the publication of schedule data. Omnibus will launch a 2.4 validator
            and export in autumn 2020.

            Speak with your Local Transport Authority about the TransXChange data they can provide
            to you. Methods of producing TransXChange 2.4 include procuring scheduling
            software or using the free TxC 2.4 tool provided by DfT, from the following website:

            One of the fields within the timetables data is Block Number. Operators are encouraged to include the BlockNumber field
            in all their TransXChange 2.4 files as soon as this information becomes available to the operator because it enables
            data consumers to combine information from timetables and bus location data. This enables them to provide quality
            information to passengers. If it is not provided, partial matching methods are used, which reduces the quality of data
            that third parties can supply to passengers. It also reduces the number of data consumers willing to use the data within
            their apps and services. The corresponding object in the location data is BlockRef, often powered by running boards or
            driver duties.

        {% blocktrans %}
            Use the RevisionNumber in your TransXChange file to indicate the TransXChange file you are replacing. It will be
            important to indicate to consumers of your data how to connect datasets and maintain version control. If multiple files
            are valid within a period the highest revision number should be considered the correct file.

            The guide is for technology suppliers (ETM and scheduling software) as well as operators. It provides an overview of how
            the TransXChange model works, a detailed description of the schema elements, worked examples and technical annexes,
            including a specification of the integrity rules used in TransXchange.
