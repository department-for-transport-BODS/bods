            The Bus Open Data Service is committed to ensuring the most
            robust quality of data is available on BODS. As of such we take
            special care in ensuring that high data quality is maintained
            through various ways as outlined below.

                Currently for timetables data, BODS mandates that all publishers
                produce timetables data in TransXChange 2.4 v1.1A PTI
                profile. This profile is an extension of general schema and makes
                certain fields mandatory, whilst clarifying the specific use of
                some other fields in TransXChange. The full PTI profile can be
                found here:

            The timetables data which is the above approved version is known
            as 'BODS Compliant data' and is flagged as such in different
            parts of the Find Bus Open Data Service (including Browse,
            Download all, Data Catalogue and the API).

            Additionally, beyond the BODS Compliant tagging, BODS also does
            data quality checks which include key data-quality observations
            that would adversely impact the passenger experience, if
            unaddressed. The full list of checks can be found

            BODS also generates a data quality score which can be seen as
            flagged in different parts of the Find Bus Open Data
            Service (including Browse, Changelog, Download all, Data
            Catalogue, and the API). The mechanism which the BODS algorithm
            uses to generate a data quality score can be found

                BODS will deliver new additions to the service to ensure

                updates on this should be available to consumers via the Find Bus
