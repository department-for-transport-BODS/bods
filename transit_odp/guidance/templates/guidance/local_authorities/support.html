            Local transport authorities may support operators by sending them the digitised
            TranXChange files made from their paper registration. The operator can then publish
            it on the service.

            A number of smaller bus operators may wish to post bus information to you,
            as many are currently doing whilst registering a service. You may offer to send
            these files to operators or support them in producing their TransXChange files for
            the service.

            Methods of producing TransXChange 2.4 include procuring scheduling software or
            using the free TxC 2.4 tool provided by DfT, from the following website:

            A limited number of operators still do not have ETMs that can provide SIRI-VM
            data which aligns with the Department for Transport SIRI-VM Profile. This also
            enables crowding information to be provided to the service.

            Operators who have ETM suppliers can talk with them about hosted NeTEx solutions.
            A large proportion of fares data already resides within ETM systems.
            This can be leveraged to provide NeTEx to BODS. There may be a need for
            additional product development, so ensure your needs are understood by your supplier.
